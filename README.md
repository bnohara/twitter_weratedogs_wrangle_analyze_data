# Project: Wrangle and analyze data from the WeRateDogs account on Twitter
Third project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The goal is to wrangle and analyze data about dogs from the WeRateDogs account on Twitter.

## Description of files
* **wrangle_act.ipynb** - Code for gathering, assessing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data
* **wrangle_report_v02.pdf** - Documentation for data wrangling steps: gather, assess, and clean
* **act_report_v02.pdf** - Documentation for analysis of cleaned data
* **twitter_archive_enhanced.csv** - File provided for the project
* **image_predictions.tsv** - File downloaded programmatically from Udacity server. The data is from a Udacity neural network that classifies breeds of dogs based on the image. Note that I didn't create the neural network. Rather, the file was provided to students for some data analysis exercises.
* **tweet_json.txt** - File constructed via calls to the Twitter API
* **twitter_archive_master.csv** - Cleaned data set
